# manhattanly 0.2.0 (2016-11-17)

* `evaluate` argument deprecated (@thebioengineer, #4)
* Hover annotations for highlighted SNPs bug fixed (@mshadbolt, #6)
* Reduced size of `Introduction to manhattanly` vignette by using `html_vignette` (instead of `html_document`) which by default uses smaller plot sizes. See sahirbhatnagar.com/manhattanly for full vignette.
